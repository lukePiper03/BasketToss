The objective of the game is to use your mouse to determine the trajectory of your shot and attempt to score by throwing the basketball into the hoop (which spawns in random spots each shot).

Initially, the game is relatively straightforward, but users can increase the level of difficulty by introducing wind to the environment or activating hard mode. In hard mode, the hoop moves along the y-axis, becoming more faster and challenging to hit with each successful shot.
